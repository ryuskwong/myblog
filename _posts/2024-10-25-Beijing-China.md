I woke up from bed and had some food and I played some prodigy after we went to the mall to get a neck pillow and a notebook. We also went to the chocolate café and then we went back home to pack. 

## Friday 

After we went on the plane to Beijing in China to see my auntie and uncle and cousins, we were also going to go to the great wall of China and the city, and Universal Studios. I was very excited to do trick-or-treating. I went to the school to work yesterday. It was called the international school of Beijing. My cousins names are Kiki and Makai. And my uncle and auntie teach there too the school is like 10 times the size of our school. Do you spell art tennis a playground library and more. there is 1800 students the school is 45 years old.

I went on this glass platform at 'Shilin Mountain' that was very very high up and there were 250 steps. It was called the UFO. And when we were almost there I got sprayed by water it was very fun and I really enjoyed it.
